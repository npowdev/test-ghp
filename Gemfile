# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!
# gem "jekyll", "3.4.3"

# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites. You may change this to anything you like.
# gem "minima", "~> 2.0"

# If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
# uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# If you have any plugins, put them here!
# group :jekyll_plugins do

# GitHub Metadata Jekyll plugin need authentication to propagate the 
# 'site.github' namespace and set default values of some fields and 
# get data: 
#
#   1. First, generate a new personal access token on GitHub.com:
# 
#       Open https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
#       Token need scope public_repo selected.
#       Save settings and copy the token you see on the page.
# 
#   2. Once you have your token, you need to pass it to this program:
#       1. Set environment var JEKYLL_GITHUB_TOKEN to the token value.
#               ...or...
#       2. Set JEKYLL_GITHUB_TOKEN to your access token when you run 
#          jekyll, like this:
# 
#          $ JEKYLL_GITHUB_TOKEN=123abc [bundle exec] jekyll serve
# 

# Windows: Needed in Gemfile to avoid polling for changes.
